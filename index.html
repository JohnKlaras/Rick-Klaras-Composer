                When PDX artist workshop Foster Row decided to create a video for their Kickstarter campaign, they knew they needed a soundtrack that captured the ethos of the shop - creative, industrious, and friendly.
              </p>
              <p>
               with the help of the shop's resident artisans, I recorded audio samples of every object capable of making noise, then taught them all to sing. Every sound in this track was taken from that session. The track opens with the loom at work, the bass is actually an air compressor, and that piano is really the sound of a sawblade being lightly plucked, then amplified.

              PDX Pet Design's Licki Brush is a pretty unusual product. There's nothing quite like it, and it's only fitting that it should have a music video that's every bit as odd as the Licki Brush itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this video, the mysterious and elusive Kevin Byloos gives Frankly the cat a star-making pep talk before ushering her to the stage at Tokyo Stadium, ostensibly. There, she's surrounded by a cast of characters including, but not limited to Santa Claus, the Moth Woman, the Wolf Man, an anthropomorphic hot dog, and a being made of cymbals.
            </p>
            <p>
              This song has it all: auto-tune abuse, a pulsating synth bass line, and lyrics about all the zany antics household cats have been known to engage in: crank-paging clients, using too much body wash, and failing to attend Halloween parties to which they were most certainly invited. <br  />Whiskey may have played a role.

                  There's a haunting quality to painter and illustrator Nathaniel Gibson's work. Whether he's creating album art, magazine covers, or film posters, his inimitable style always shines through.

                <p>
                  When he mentioned that he was working on a children's book about a lonely black hole, I could hear the soundtrack for it in my head, and I was eager to see what I knew would be brilliant illustrations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But how to score a children's book? We decided to reinvision it in the style of a vintage filmstrip - extended shots, narration, minimal movement. The score was created with a guitar and a single analog mono synthesizer: my prized Moog MG-1.

                    I love the sci-fi soundtracks of the '70s and '80s. To me, there's just something magical about Vangelis's majestic <i>Blade Runner</i> score, the menacing soundscape of John Carpenter's <i>Escape from New York</i>, and the robotic classicism of Wendy Carlos's work on <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also have a fondness for synth pop, new wave, and early electronic artists such as Tangerine Dream, Jean Michel Jarre, Silver Apples, Tubeway Army, Blondie, and the Cars.

                  <p>
                    Hairstyles of the Great Composers is my outlet for that sort of inspiration. It's an ongoing project, with more music to come in the (hopefully not too dystopian) future.

                      This project began when I was asked to compose meditative music for a health spa. Alas, the spa never came to fruition, but the music remains as relaxing and pretty as ever.

                      Creating these tracks was an interesting exercise in restraint for me. It was really tempting to drop a disgusting beat or a grimy bassline over the top of everthing. Of course if I had, it wouldn't be nearly as calming.

                        For a substantial part of younger years, this band was my life, my religion, and my extended family. We never landed a record deal or got much attention outside our little microcosm, but I'm still proud of the music we created together.

                      <p>
                        And damn, did we have a lot of fun! We played shows with bands we loved all over Arizona, signed autographs, and had crazy hotel parties. Most importantly, we made music we loved and believed in with all our hearts, and we played like the world was going to end at any moment.
                      </p>

                        It's not perfect, but give it a listen. There's some fierce and fragile magic in these songs - little moments where everything came together just right.

                            I am a songwriter and recordist at heart, and while there's nothing quite like fleshing out material with a full band, sometimes I can't help but fire up my rig and track demos for the songs I have rattling around in my brain.

The guitars, synths, bass and vocals are all overdubbed in my home studio. The drums are sequenced, because I can't play drums to save my life.

                            I hear music in everything. I sing harmonies with window fans and warning buzzers. I listen to AM radio between the stations. I've made organ sounds from electrical transformer hum and massive kick drums out of clawfoot bathtubs.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Making music with found sound is freeing. So much is already decided. The sounds are what they are. All I have to do is turn them into music.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Though the sounds are basically noise pollution, I try to imbue the pieces with musicality and emotional resonance that give the listener something to hold on to. Idiot Savant is the sobriquet I've given my found-sound experiments. Enjoy!
                          </p>
