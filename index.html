                When PDX artist workshop Foster Row decided to create a video for their Kickstarter campaign, they knew they needed a soundtrack that captured the ethos of the shop - creative, industrious, and friendly.
              </p>
              <p>
                with the help of the shop's resident artisans, I recorded audio samples of every object capable of making noise, then taught them all to sing. Every sound in this track was taken from that session. The track opens with the loom at work, the bass is actually an air compressor, and that piano is really the sound of a sawblade being lightly plucked, then amplified.

                  There's a haunting quality to painter and illustrator Nathaniel Gibson's work. Whether he's creating album art, magazine covers, or film posters, his inimitable style always shines through.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When he mentioned that he was working on a children's book about a lonely black hole, I could hear the soundtrack for it in my head, and I was eager to see what I knew would be brilliant illustrations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But how to score a children's book? We decided to reinvision it in the style of an educational filmstrip - extended shots, narration, minimal movement. The score was created with a guitar and a single analog mono synthesizer: my prized 1981 Moog MG-1.

                    I love the sci-fi soundtracks of the '70s and '80s. To me, there's just something magical about Vangelis's majestic Blade Runner score, the menacing soundscape from John Carpenter's Escape from New York, and the robotic classicism of Wendy Carlos's work on A Clockwork Orange.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also have a fondness for synthpop and new wave artists such as Tubeway Army, Silver Apples, Blondie, and the Cars, not to mention more recent artists influenced by that general category of music.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hairstyles of the Great Composers is my outlet for that sort of inspiration. It's an ongoing project, with more music to come in the (hopefully not dystopian) future.
